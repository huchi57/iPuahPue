# Appendix: What is "Pua̍h-Pue"?
Pua̍h-Pue is a ritual practice in many Asian regions where a pair of crescent shaped wooden pieces, called Pue, are thrown. The resting positions of the Pues after thrown are then used to seek divine guidances, usually from yes-no questions. A Pue block is round on one side and flat on the other. Since each Pue block has two sides, there are usually four outcomes and three results:

| Pue 1 | Pue 2 | Result | Probability | Yes-No Answer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Up | Up | Laughing Answer | 25% | No |
| Up | Down | **Divine Answer** | 25% | Yes |
| Down | Up | **Divine Answer** | 25% | Yes |
| Down | Down | No Answer / Angry Answer / Crying Answer | 25% | No |

1. **Divine Answer (50%):** When exactly one Pue block is facing upwards, and the other downwards. It is a *yes* answer.
2. **Laughing Answer (25%):** When both Pue blocks are facing upwards, meaning the Gods are smiling. It can be interpreted as a *no* answer, the question is unclear, or when the answer is obvious that need not to be asked.
3. **No Answer / Angry Answer / Crying Answer (25%):** When both Pue blocks are facing down, meaning the Gods are displeased or disagree with the asked question. It is a *no* answer.

However, in very rare circumstances, Pue blocks might rest at unusal positions, resulting in the following results:

4. **Standing Answer (near 0%):** When either one of the Pue block stands on its own edge.
5. **Concentric Answer (near 0%):** When a Pue block overlays on the other.

Different regions intepret these results differently, but they are usually considered miracles.
